# cra-sass
Simply setup SASS within create react app, as per the CRA readme. 

## Install & Use

1. INSTALL : `npm install -g cra-sass --save` ( As with CRA I suggest installing this globally)
2. RUN IT : `cra-sass` ( from within your CRA install )

## What it does

1. Installs `node-sass-chokidar` & `npm-run-all`
2. Adds the scripts and ties up the package json.

## NOTES
This does overwrite the default scripts, etc etc. If you are worried backup your package.json :)
